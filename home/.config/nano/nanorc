# Automatically indent a newly created line to the same number of tabs and/or
# spaces as the previous line (or as the next line if the previous line is the
# beginning of a paragraph).
set autoindent

# Toggles the constant display of the current line, column and character pos.

# Set ruler at 81 width: The ruler is slightly wide, and with 81, the left side
# of the ruler is directly at column 80.
set guidestripe 81

# Color for the vertical guide rules from 'guidestripe' above. The guide line is
# 2 pixels wide for some reason, and the right-edge of it is the one that is at
# the specified 80 width. So it looks annoying when getting close to 80 width,
# as the few characters before are underneath the guidestripe. Trying to fix
# this as well as possible with this colorization option
set stripecolor normal,black

# Set the target width for justifying and automatic hard-wrapping at this number
# of columns.
set fill 80

## Use bold text instead of reverse video text.
set boldtext

## The characters treated as closing brackets when justifying

set brackets ""')>]}"

## Do case sensitive searches by default.
#set casesensitive

## Enable ~/.nano_history for saving and reading search/replace strings.
set historylog

## The opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Allow multiple file buffers (inserting a file will put it into a
## separate buffer).  You must have configured with --enable-multibuffer
## for this to work.
#set multibuffer

#set noconvert

## Don't follow symlinks when writing files.
#set nofollow

#set nohelp

## Don't add newlines to the ends of files.
#set nonewlines

## Don't wrap text at all.
#set nowrap

## Set operating directory.  nano will not read or write files outside
## this directory and its subdirectories.  Also, the current directory
## is changed to here, so any files are inserted from this dir.  A blank
## string means the operating directory feature is turned off.
#set operatingdir ""

## Preserve the XON and XOFF keys (^Q and ^S).
#set preserve

## The characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
## paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing
## punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end
## sentences.
set punct "!.?;"

## Do quick statusbar blanking.  Statusbar messages will disappear after
## 1 keystroke instead of 26.  Note that "const" overrides this.
#set quickblank

## The email-quote string, used to justify email-quoted paragraphs.
## This is an extended regular expression if your system supports them,
## otherwise a literal string.  Default:
#set quotestr "^([ 	]*[#:>\|}])+"
## if you have extended regular expression support, otherwise:
#set quotestr "> "

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.
#set rebinddelete

## Fix numeric keypad key confusion problem.
#set rebindkeypad

## Do extended regular expression searches by default.
set regexp

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
set smarthome

## Use smooth scrolling as the default. (Deprecated? Error: Unknown option)
#set smooth

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
set speller "aspell -x -c"

## Allow nano to be suspended.

## Disallow file modification; why would you want this in an rcfile?
#set view

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
